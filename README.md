# PulseWavesIO.jl
Julia package for reading the PulseWaves lidar data format.

## Overview

This is a native Julia implementation to read the full waveform lidar data format [PulseWaves](https://github.com/PulseWaves/Specification/blob/master/specification.rst).

## Example usage

## Roadmap

A goal of this project is to [register the implementation for PulseWaves with FileIO.jl](https://juliaio.github.io/FileIO.jl/stable/registering/) to make it available to users without any extra effort.
Before that happens, the code needs to be thoroughly tested and refined to ensure it works smoothly.

Therefore, __please report any issues you find or submit a pull request__. Thanks!
